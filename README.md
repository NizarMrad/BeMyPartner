# BeMyPartner

BeMyPartner is a plateforme designed to facilitate collaborations between entrepreneurs who are looking for partners to work with, and  specialists (in any field of competence) who want to take part in a project. 
The goal is to help project initiators to pass above one of the problems they may face  to develop their projects : the lack of competences and the search of reliables partners. In the same time, some people who have interesting skills may want to start an entrepreneurial advenure, without having a project or a team.
let's make them meet !
